## jQuery Todo List

Complete the jQuery Todo List so that it has the following features:

- [ ] Add new tasks to the list on the right-hand side
- [ ] The submit button is disabled until there is content in the task text box and a category has been selected
- [ ] When a task is submitted, the form is cleared
- [ ] When a task is added, the number of Todos increments
- [ ] When the "Remove Me" badge is clicked, that item is removed from the page
- [ ] When the "Remove Me" badge is clicked, the total number of Todos should decrement
